The purpose of these exercises is to put into practice the knowlege about semantic HTML.

You must to create a page that features one of the most impressive animals that exists: link:{link1}[Stomatopoda]. The styling of the page is up to you.

For better organization, make commits to each completed task. Let's go to the exercises:

. Add a header on the page with the title *Punch at 80km/h: Meet Stomatopoda*.
. Add a set of links that represent the navigation area of ​​the website.
. Create a link called *Home*.
. Create a link called *About*.
. Create a link called *Contact*.
. Create an article that will contain the interesting facts about *Stomatopoda*. The article will be subtitled *Facts about Stomatopoda*. Follow an link:{link2}[animal-inspired website] to get facts.
. Divide the article into sections, organizing it as follows:
. A first section containing general information about the animal. The subtitle for this section is at your discretion. It is necessary that its scientific name, which is *Odontodactylus scyllarus*, appear in this section in italics. In addition, there must be tabular information regarding their scientific classification, specifically: *Kingdom*, *Phylum*, *Subphylum*, *Class*, *Subclass* and *Order*. You can get such information link:{link3}[from Wikipedia].
. The other sections relate to the interesting facts you chose about the animal. For each chosen fact you will create a section.
. Add, for each section, a subtitle referring to the chosen fact.
. Add, for each section, paragraph (s) describing the chosen fact. Highlight impressive features related to the suit you chose, in order to reinforce the Stomatopoda's uniqueness. ]
. For example: if you create a section detailing the animal's powerful punch, it would be interesting to highlight the speed of that punch (80km / h) in bold.
. Add an image for each section as a way of illustrating the fact.
. Finally, add a section of bibliographic references, containing a list of all the links that were used as a basis to compile the page in question.
. Add content adjacent to the article, providing a link to link:{link4}[this video], which shows the animal in action.
. Add a footer to the page, showing something like this:

====
----
"Conteúdo compilado por <insere seu nome>, <ano atual>".
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
For this exercise, it is mandatory to use at least 6 elements with the following tags: header, nav ,article ,section ,h1 , h2, h3, aside, footer, table and img.

== Exercise - Part 3
=== Validating the exercise 
Now that you have created the page showing interesting facts about Stomatopoda, suppose that a person with visual impairment accesses your page. Will your page be accessible to that person? Let's find out!

Enter this site, which validates whether your page is accessible or not. On the site there are 3 ways for you to submit your HTML code:

. Via url (the first, already selected when loading the site).
. Via uploading the HTML file (second tab).
. Via copying + pasting the HTML code (third and last tab).

When submitting the code, you will come across validation errors present on your page, starting your third exercise: *fixing all the errors pointed out*.

For each validation error shown, a link to the page with its description is available. Before going back to the code and fixing it, read the description of each error *to understand* and be able to fix it.

At the end of the exercise, in addition to having an accessible page, you will reinforce the practice of *fixing errors*, be it validation (for this exercise) or logic, which you will encounter throughout your developer career.
