== Regular Exercises

. For today's first exercise, make a program that, given any value n, whether n> 1, print on the screen a square made of side asterisks of size n. For example:

[source, javascript]
----
n = 5

*****
*****
*****
*****
*****

. For the second exercise, do the same as before, but print a right triangle with 5 base asterisks. For example:

[source, javascript]
----
n = 5

*
**
***
****
*****
----

. Now invert the side of the triangle. For example:

[source, javascript]
----
n = 5

    *
   **
  ***
 ****
*****

. Then, make a pyramid with n basic asterisks:

[source, javascript]
----
n = 5

  *
 ***
*****
----

== Bonus Exercises

. Make a pyramid with n base asterisks that is empty in the middle. Assume that the value of n will always be odd:

[source, javascript]
----
//Finally, let us increase the variable with the value corresponding to each loop;
n = 7

. Make a program that says whether a number defined in a variable is prime or not.
** A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself, that is, dividing it with any other .. numbers gives a remainder other than zero.
** Tip: you will need to loop from 0 to the defined number; In addition, you will need to check each iteration and store the results somewhere.
