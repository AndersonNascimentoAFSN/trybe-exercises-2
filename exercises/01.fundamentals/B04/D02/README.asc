== Exercises

Read the statements carefully and do as you are asked! You will use this array to perform exercises 1 through 7:

[source, javascript]
----
let numbers = [5, 9, 3, 19, 70, 8, 100, 2, 35, 27];
----

. In this first exercise, go through the array by printing all the values ​​contained in it with the function console.log ();
. For the second exercise, you must add all the values ​​contained in the array and print the result;
For the third exercise, calculate and print the arithmetic mean of the values ​​contained in the array;
. The arithmetic mean is the result of the sum of all elements divided by the total number of elements.
. With the same code as in the previous exercise, if the final value is greater than 20, print the message: "value greater than 20". If not, print the message: "value less than or equal to 20";
. Using for, find out which is the highest value contained in the array and print it;
. Find out how many odd values ​​are in the array and print the result. If none exist, print the message: "no odd values ​​found";
. Using for, find out what is the lowest value in the array and print it;
. Using for, create an array that goes from 1 to 25 and print the result;
. Using the array created in the previous exercise, print the result of dividing each of the elements by 2.

for (let i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
    if (array[i] < array[j]) {
      let position = array[i];

      array[i] = array[j];
      array[j] = position;
    }
  }
}

. Order the array *numbers* in ascending order and print their values;
. Order the array *numbers* in descending order and print their values;
. You will now create a new array from the *numbers* array, without losing it. Each value of the new array must be equal to the corresponding value in the array *numbers* multiplied by the following. For example: the first value of the new array should be 45, as it is the multiplication of 5 (first value) and 9 (next value). The second value of the new array should be 27, since it is the multiplication of 9 (second value) and 3 (next value), and so on. If there is no next value, the multiplication must be done by 2. Do this using the *for* and *push* method. The result should be the array below:

[45, 27, 57, 1330, 560, 800, 200, 70, 945, 54]
